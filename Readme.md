Flow.Launcher.Plugin.JetBrainsIDEProjects
==================

A plugin for the [Flow launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher).

Currently it only supports JetBrains IDEs installed via the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Also it won't work if you have changed the configuration directory of your IDEs.

Send me a Issue or a PR if you want to add support for them.

The way Toolbox and tools record recent projects changes frequently, so please feel free to submit an issue if you have any problems (e.g., projects from a certain IDE are not showing up).
